There is an Arch AUR package of cstitch available at
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cstitch-git/

The binary linux version of Cstitch available at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cstitch/files/Cstitch/ was compiled
against a 64-bit static build of Qt 5.2.8 on Fedora 24.

If the binary doesn't run on your linux system, your best bet is to
compile the source - see INSTALL_linux.md at
https://github.com/kleintom/Cstitch/blob/master/INSTALL_linux.md for
instructions.
